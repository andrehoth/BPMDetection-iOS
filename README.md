# BPMDetection-iOS
Bare bones BPM detection of local files

This repo allows you to estimate the BPM of a local audio file.
The technology is based on Superpowered, an open source library.  http://superpowered.com

I have been having trouble setting up Cocoapods for this repo.  Please just simply copy the files into your project.  
A music file and view controller are provided for example.
